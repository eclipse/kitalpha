'''Viewpoint lifecycle - States''' 

{| class="wikitable"
|'''State'''
|'''Description'''
|- 
|''Uninstalled''
|The viewpoint is not physically installed on the platform.
|- 
|''Installed''
|The viewpoint is correctly installed on the platform and visible from the Viewpoint Manager View.
|- 
|''Unreferenced'' 
|The viewpoint is not referenced in the model. No data (e.g. model elements, diagram elements) from the viewpoint is present in the model. No service from the viewpoint is active on the model.
|- 
|''Referenced'' 
|The viewpoint is referenced in the model. Data corresponding to the viewpoint can be present in the model. 
|- 
|''Inactive'' 
|The viewpoint is inactive on the model. Data corresponding to the viewpoint can be present in the model, but will not be displayed to the end user. Services from the viewpoint are not active.
|- 
|''Active'' 
|The viewpoint is active on the model. Data is present and displayed to the end user. Services from the viewpoint is active.

|'''Action'''
|'''Description'''
|- 
|''install''

|- 
|''unreference''
|This action launches a detachment to cleanly remove the viewpoint(s) in the project. The viewpoint metadata are updated.

== Representation of the transitions ==
Each transition is implemented by an action represented as follows.
